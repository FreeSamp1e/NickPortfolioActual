        <p class="aboutMeText">
          Hello! My name is Nick Sample. I am currently a rising Senior at
          Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School. I was born in Anderson, Indiana,
          and have lived in Indianapolis since 2017. My sister, Sophia Sample,
          20, is a rising Senior at Purdue University, and my mother emigrated
          from Japan. Throughout my life, I have been captivated by STEM,
          technological engineering, and coding. Specifically, the limitless,
          creative opportunities that these fields allow one to pursue is what
          interests me so much in engineering and computer science.
